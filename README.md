Hello!

AutoFactory is created by DanieL Dollerup, for teaching purposes in .NET MVC, but it can be used with pretty much anything.

I've used it for games, websites, web apps, native apps and much more.

You are free to use this as you wish, as long as you credit me :)

It's a database first(ish) approach, where you create models based on your tables in the database, and the use the AutoFactory tool, to create CRUD elements, based on the models.

For Examples on how to use it, check out the example project included :)

Well, it doesn't actually work without a database, but it shows how to generally use it :)

Thank you! :)
